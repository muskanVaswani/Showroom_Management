<h3>Basic Java OOP CLI Project</h3>
<p>This project is a simple Command-Line Interface (CLI) application built in Java. It demonstrates the four key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts:</p>

@Encapsulation<br>
@Inheritance<br>
@Abstraction<br>
@Polymorphism<br>

<p>The current version is a basic implementation which helped me understand these core OOP principles in action.</p>
